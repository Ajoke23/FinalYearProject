IMPROVED ESTIMATION OF FORMATION VOLUME FACTOR OF NIGER DELTA CRUDE OIL SYSTEM USING MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH

Understanding reservoir flow behavior and correctly quantifying reservoir productivity depends 
on accurate reservoir fluid characterization. 

Over the years, a wide range of methods have been suggested to determine the formation volume factor for oil. 
These correlations fall short of its accuracy when applied to Niger Delta crude oil system.
This study developed a correlation for the formation volume factor of crude oil from the Niger 
Delta and assessed whether it was necessary to use locally created correlation when evaluating 
the formation volume factor (ùêµùëú). 
A machine learning approach was used in the study. A process of model development was created
using the PVT dataset of the Niger Delta Crude Oil System to evaluate the oil formation volume 
factor. 

The model algorithm selection (linear regression) was based on the various statistical 
metrics which shows why multiple linear regression performed excellently than ridge and lasso.


This method involves the use of an empirical correlation which was developed using Python 
codes and linear regression machine learning techniques.
